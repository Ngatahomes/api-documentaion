## AES encryption
### Description
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely used to secure sensitive data. AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. <br>

### Usage

Encryption and Decryption keys <u>(IV and SECRET KEY)</u> will be sent to  validated third-party client emails.

### Plots

We show a scatter plot in this section.

```{r, fig.dim=c(5, 3)}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .5, .1))
plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, pch = 19)
```

### Tables

We show the data in this tab.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```
